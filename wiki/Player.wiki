#summary Description of the Player class

= Player =

SparCraft implements all unit action decisions via the Player class. Player is an abstract class which contains the `getMoves` function:

{{{
void Player::getMoves(GameState & state, const MoveArray & moves, std::vector<UnitAction> & moveVec);
}}}

`getMoves` takes as input a GameState, a MoveArray (an array of all possible moves for this player from this state), and a vector of UnitActions. `getMoves` will then perform combat logic to populate the vector with UnitActions to be performed by that player at that state.
