#summary AI Algorithms included in SparCraft

= Artificial Intelligence =

One of the main reasons for the release of this project was so that there could be a system for testing various AI algorithms for RTS combat. Many publications have presented work on RTS combat AI, however each one is implemented in a different system, and are often limited by simulation speed or by the time it takes to write a full simulation system.

Not only is SparCraft a full simulation system, but it also includes several AI algorithms we have developed for RTS combat.

= Scripted Players =

Many static scripted players come with SparCraft, they are:

{{{
AttackClosest
AttackDPS
AttackWeakest
Cluster
Kiter
KiterDPS
NOKDPS
Random
}}}

= Alpha Beta =

We have developed a version of Alpha Beta tree search called Alpha Beta Considering Durations (ABCD). This algorithm was introduced in the following 2012 AIIDE paper: [https://skatgame.net/mburo/ps/aiide12-combat.pdf Fast Heuristic Search for RTS Game Combat Scenarios].

The algorithm is implemented in `SparCraft/source/AlphaBetaSearch.cpp`

= UCT Tree Search =

UCT is another popular tree search algorithm, and we have modified it for use with RTS combat. It is available in `SparCraft/source/UCTSearch.cpp`

= Portfolio Greedy Search =

Our newest greedy search technique which loses to AB/UCT at small combat sizes, but easily defeats them at larger sizes. It is implemented in `SparCraft/source/PortfolioGreedySearch.cpp`
