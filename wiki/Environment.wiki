  * BWAPI_DIR - BWAPI root directory
  * BOOST_DIR - BOOST root directory

SparCraft comes with a Windows .bat file located in `SparCraft/VisualStudio/set_environment_variables.bat` which you can edit and run to set these variables for you. 

Alternatively, you can edit these in Windows 7 right click "My Computer" > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables:
